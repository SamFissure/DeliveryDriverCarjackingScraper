Right now, just a project idea.
There has been a recent uptick in carjackings
and it has been specifically affecting food 
delivery drivers like myself.  
The goal for this was to  
PART 1
Scrape a website for carjacking reports (probably with Python, cannot find suitable website)
Includes if it's a delivery driver. 
PART 2 
Create a database of these incidents (SQL) 
PART 3 
Make a backend that is searchable by address 
PART 4 
Build a frontend that pulls the location and puts it on a map alongside other locations  
(possibly leverage Google Maps). 

This is on hold, and if anyone else can think of a website to scrape, let me know.
It turns out that the statistics I want are not widely published.
